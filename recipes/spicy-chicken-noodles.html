    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy chicken noodles dish is perfect for using up leftover chicken, assuming it wasn't horribly overcooked in the first place. If you did want to use raw chicken, go ahead and chop it up, and stir-fry it for a minute or two before adding your vegetables.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large carrot, finely sliced or shredded</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces cooked chicken breast, torn into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>Â½ cup freshly chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place carrots, cabbage, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic in a mixing bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat large skillet over high heat; drizzle in vegetable oil. When oil is hot (almost but not quite smoking), add the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until vegetables are hot and steamy, 1 or 2 minutes. Pour in sauce; cook and stir over high heat until sauce starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Add noodles and chicken. Cook and stir to blend ingredients and ensure ingredients are hot, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add chopped cilantro; stir.</p></li>
    </ol>
