    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>What a wonderful dish! I wanted something different today, and this fit the bill. It has a nice bite to it!! The only thing I did differently was I used a box of Japanese Ramen Noodles for the noodles. I also cooked everything double the time stated..I like my cabbage and carrots cooked til soft, that's just me.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chile paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an additional 30 seconds. Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and keep warm.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the emptied pan combine the onion, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining soy sauce, cooked noodles, and the chicken mixture to pan and mix to blend. Serve and enjoy!</p></li>
